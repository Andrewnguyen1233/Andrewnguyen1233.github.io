    <h3>
        The Story Of My Game
    </h3>
    <p>
        At first I was thinking of making a geometry dash, but then Mario looked better so I dropped geometry dash and went for Mario, then I realized that I didn't know how to make the screen look like it is moving, so thought of a game that does not require the screen to move. That's when the game knife hit popped in my head, I tried to make the the game as close to the original as possible, but it seemed impossible to get the sprites to do what I want it to do. So i kept the idea of knife hit in mind, but changed it up so that I could have more control over what happens, that's when I created "Target Hit"
    </p>
    <h4>
        Scoring System & Randomness Occurance
    </h4>
    <p>
        When the kinfe hits the target the user gets one point. The randomness occurs when you reach 15 points or higher because the game has a chance of spawning mroe tiles.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Difficulty Increase and End Game
    </h4>
    <p>
        After the first 15 knives hit the target the horizontal line starts moving faster making you have to be more cautious on when to click. The game ends only when the knife hits the moving line other than that, it will keep getting faster and faster make it harder to play.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Relection of Game
    </h2>
    <p>
        I made this game because I used to play it a lot and I think I got to level 200 something, which inspired me to try and create an easy game that goes on forever.<br>
        2 succesful points in the development process of my game was getting the knife to respond to my keys and and getting the line to move faster as the game goes on. <br>
        2 obstacles in the development process of my game was trying to get the knife to spin and try to make it so if it were touching a certain color on the the wheel it would end the game, but that never happened. <br>
        If I had more time I would improve the scoring syste because right now when someone spams or holds the space key the score would go negative, even though I try my best to prevent that from happening.

        Important Algorithm

    <p>
        This is important because this allows the sprite to spawn and respond to the the key needed to hit the target.
